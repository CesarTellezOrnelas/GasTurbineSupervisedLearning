## Overview
This program implements a linear regression model to predict Turbine Energy Yield (TEY) based on operational data from gas turbines. It fetches a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, preprocesses the data, trains the model, evaluates its performance, and visualizes the results, including residuals.

## Key Features
- **Data Fetching**: Retrieves the Gas Turbine CO and NOx Emission dataset from the UCI repository.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Splits the dataset into training and testing sets, preparing the features and target variable for modeling.
- **Model Training**: Implements a linear regression model to predict TEY.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assesses model performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and RÂ² Score.
- **Data Visualization**: Generates visualizations, including a histogram of TEY values and a residual plot with LOWESS smoothing to identify patterns in prediction errors.

## Technologies and Skills Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: 
  - `pandas` for data manipulation and analysis
  - `seaborn` and `matplotlib` for data visualization
  - `sklearn` for implementing machine learning models
  - `ucimlrepo` for accessing datasets from the UCI repository
- **Data Analysis**: Skills in data preprocessing, statistical analysis, and model evaluation.
- **Machine Learning**: Understanding of linear regression concepts and evaluation metrics.
